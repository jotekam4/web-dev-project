        <h1>Summary and Recommendation</h1>
        <p>The price of all the hosting services providers is almost the same but there is a lot more to it than just price. 
            Every option has its own pros and cons. Bluehost supports a lot of script languages while HostGator provides 
            unlimited storage. Hostinger might be the cheapest but doesnt support many languages and has a lower uptime.<br><br>
            According to websitebuilderexpert.com Bluehost is the top recommended provider for WordPress websites. With comprehensive 
            features and excellent customer service, it provides great value for money for small personal projects.
            <br><br>After analysing all the pros/cons and looking through the reviews of each provider I personally would go with Bluehost 
            becuase they have almost 100% uptime so they are very reliable and their claims matchup with the user reviews. Moreover, Bluehost 
            supports plethora of scripting languages so if I wanted to learn any of those languages in the near future I'm covered on that. While 
            HostGator has good storage and uptime, their language support is not upto par with Bluehost plus the reviews are not good either.
