            <h1>Design & Aesthetic</h1>
            <p>According to the article mentioned below beautiful website lures the user to explore it even further 
                which is a great plus point. Talking about my older e-portfolio the design 
                was really out-dated and the website was not very pleasing to look at which is a 
                big negative. So I revamped the whole design and made a fresh website with up-to date
                design.

            <h1>Consistency</h1>
            <p>A website which has consistent design elements on every web-page makes for a 
                phenomenal site that every user wants to visit. In my earlier website there weren't many
                consistent elements to tie the whole website together. According to the article below 
                having a consistent desing makes out website unique and gives it a identity.

                <h1>Content</h1>
                <p>Earlier My website's homepage was filled to the brim with long paragraphs, but after researching 
                    on the internet and according to 11 Golden Rules of Writing Content for Your Website | 
                    Jimdo Blog (2019). I found out that having short paragraphs and having white space makes 
                    the website more welcoming so I took out a lot of written content.
